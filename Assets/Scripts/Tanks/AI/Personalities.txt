- The Stickler -
	The Stickler will follow the waypoints incrementally
		i.e
		   if (location == currentWayPoint)
	           {
                       currentWayPoint++;
                   }
- The StickInTheMud -
	The Stick in the mud will only patrol between two waypoints
		i.e
		   if (location == currentWayPoint)
                   {
                       if (currentWayPoint == firstWayPoint)
                       {
                          currentWayPoint++; 
                       }
                       else
		       {
                           currentWayPoint = firstWayPoint; 
		       }
                   } 

- The Creep -
	When the creep gets to the current waypoint he will check to see where the player is and then move to that position
		i.e 
	          if (location == currentWayPoint)
		  {
		     currentWayPoint == FindClosestWayPoint(player.position); 
		  }

- The Loose Cannon - 
	The Loose Cannon will grab a random waypoint every time it gets to the current waypoint.
		i.e 
                    if (loaction == currentWayPoint)
		    {
			currentWayPoint = RandomWayPoint();
                    }
